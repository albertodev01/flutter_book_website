## html_validator

This command-line application generates static HTML pages for the [fluttercompletereference.com](https://fluttercompletereference.com/) website. To run the program, use the `dart run` command from the project root.

> **Note**: After you've generated the pages, use the `html_validator` tool to validate the HTML.

The HTML pages are generated in the `generated/` folder.
